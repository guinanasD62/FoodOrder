**********
can you please explain to me what changes you have made to ensure that the authentication state persists across page refreshes
888888888888
redux-persist is used to automatically handle persisting the Redux state.
sessionStorage is chosen to store the authentication state, ensuring it only persists for the duration of the session.

2. Create a Redux Provider with PersistGate || redux-provider.tsx ||  wraps the application with both the Redux Provider and the PersistGate from redux-persist.
The PersistGate ensures that the persisted state is rehydrated before the app renders.

3. Use ReduxProvider in Your Next.js Layout || layout.tsx || Wrapped the application with the custom ReduxProvider
 Redux store and persisted state are available throughout the application.
Also wrapped the AuthProvider inside the ReduxProvider to maintain the context.

4.  Ensure Auth Context Relies on Redux State || auth-context.tsx || 
The AuthContext relies on Redux state for authentication data, which is now persisted using redux-persist.

store.tsx


// create resto

if the role is equal to user please navigate to http://localhost:3000/user

Redux Persist is a library that helps you save your Redux state to a storage (like localStorage or sessionStorage) so that it persists across page refreshes. In this case, we are using sessionStorage, which means the state will persist as long as the browser tab is open.
The main idea is that when the user logs in, the login action is dispatched, which updates the Redux state. The redux-persist middleware then automatically saves this state to sessionStorage. When the application is reloaded, redux-persist rehydrates (restores) the state from sessionStorage, ensuring the user remains logged in.

  Step 1: Install Dependencies
Step 2: Configure Redux Persist with Session Storage
store.ts
//
persistConfig: This is a configuration object for Redux Persist.
persistReducer: This is a function from Redux Persist that enhances your reducer to persist its state.
//2
persistReducer(persistConfig, sessionReducer): This function takes two arguments:
persistConfig: The configuration object we just created.
sessionReducer: The reducer that we want to persist.
//
How It Fits Together
Configure the Persisted Reducer: We enhance our existing reducer (sessionReducer) with persistence capabilities using persistReducer.

Step 3: Create a Redux Provider with PersistGate

Step 4: Use ReduxProvider in Your Next.js Layout
